Revision history for Perl extension Class::DBI::Schema2Code.

1.00  Thu Mar  18 10:23:29 2004
	- Original version
	- See examples/parent-module.tmpl and generic-module.tmpl for sample templates
		used to generate Perl source code
	- See examples/bootstrap.pl for code which loads 3 text files into 3 database
		tables
	- See examples/generator.pl for code which generates Local::Project::* modules for
		the 3 tables
	- See examples/reporter.pl for code which exercises the Local::Project::* modules
	- See examples/address-print.pl and campus-print.pl for subs which can be plugged
		into the generated modules Local::Project::Address.pm and Campus.pm to enhance
		the output of reporter.pl
	- See examples/reporter.log for my output after having plugged in those 2 subs.
		Your output should be identical, apart from OS-dependent line terminators.
